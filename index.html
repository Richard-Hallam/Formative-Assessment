            <p class="text-center lead">Our mental health is at least as important as our physical health. It strongly
                affects our daily
                lives – how they feel to us, as well as our ability do the things we need and
                want to, including work,
                study, getting on with people and looking after ourselves and others.

                Another way to think about mental health is like thinking about the weather. As the seasons change,
                the weather does too. There are bright and sunny days which make us feel
                happy and want to do things like going outdoors, but on other days the weather can change to darker,
                rainy days, where you don’t feel like leaving the house. Like the weather,
                your mental health can go through periods of positive and bright bursts of energy, and it can also
                dip and drag you down a darker road. You may feel tired and lack motivation
                or energy to do the simple things, such as getting out of bed or getting on with your day.

                Whatever you are feeling, know that this is completely normal, and you can seek support or speak to
                family and friends about how you are feeling.

                Many people are reluctant to talk about their feelings and their mental health – there is still a
                stigma around it. Ironically, not sharing our feelings with anyone, or even
                knowing what they are, can make our mental health worse. Talking can help us find hope again, and
                feel closer to other people.</p>

                            <p class="card-text text-center">When our mental health is good, we feel good inside. We
                                might
                                feel calm or content, peaceful, hopeful
                                and accepting of ourselves and valued by the people who matter to us.

                                Having good mental health makes life easier. It helps us to calm and comfort ourselves
                                when
                                we’re
                                upset, to cope with the losses, changes, fears and uncertainties in life,
                                to make and keep good relationships with other people and to learn.

                                Having good mental health does not mean feeling good all the time. We all have our downs
                                and
                                ups.
                                Life is full of unavoidable risks, worries and losses, which affect
                                everyone. Sometimes difficult feelings pass quickly and we bounce back. Sometimes we
                                struggle for
                                much longer. This can happen to any of us.</p>

                        <p class="card-text text-center">When our mental health is not so good, life feels more of a
                            struggle. We might often feel sad or
                            tearful, and hopeless and exhausted. We might feel under unbearable stress,
                            or often worried about bad things happening to us or people we care about. All of these are
                            very
                            common experiences.

                            Feeling down, anxious or stressed can mean we don’t have much energy for activities such as
                            work or
                            study, ‘life admin’ and looking after ourselves and others. It can be
                            hard to keep going.

                            Feeling like this for a while could be a sign that something else in our lives is wrong, or
                            that we
                            need help. It is also a natural reaction, if we’ve had a major loss or
                            shock, such as bereavement, unemployment, divorce or a serious health problem.</p>

                        <p class="card-text text-center">Regular physical activity is known to improve mental health,
                            quality of life, and wellbeing. It also
                            helps prevent and treat heart
                            disease, stroke, diabetes, and breast and colon
                            cancer, and more. Despite these benefits being well established, over a third of UK adults
                            do
                            not meet
                            the recommended amount of activity.
                            Our bodies and our minds are connected, so looking after ourselves physically also helps us
                            prevent
                            problems with our mental health. Exercise releases “feel good” hormones, that
                            reduce feelings of stress and anger. It also helps us feel better about our bodies. It can
                            improve our
                            sleep too. If it involves other people, like being part of a team, a class
                            or group we see regularly, that can also boost our mental health.

                            But a lot of us struggle to get a good night’s sleep, and the consequences can be more
                            serious
                            than

                        <h5 class="card-title text-center">Stress</h5>
                        <p class="card-text text-center">Stress is our body’s response to pressure. Many different
                            situations or
                            life events can cause stress. It
                            is often triggered when we experience something new
                            or unexpected that threatens our sense of self or when we feel we have little control over a
                            situation.

                            We all deal with stress differently. Our ability to cope can depend on our genetics, early
                            life
                            events,
                            personality and social and economic circumstances.

                            When we encounter stress, our body produces stress hormones that trigger a fight or flight
                            response
                            and
                            activate our immune system. This helps us respond quickly to dangerous
                            situations.

                            Sometimes, this stress response can be helpful. It can help us push through fear or pain so
                            we can
                            run a
                            marathon or deliver a speech, for example. Our stress hormones usually
                            return to normal quickly once the stressful event is over, and there won’t be any lasting
                            effects.

                            However, too much stress can cause adverse effects. It can leave us in a permanent stage of
                            fight or
                            flight, leaving us overwhelmed or unable to cope. Long term, this can affect
                            our physical and mental health.</p>
