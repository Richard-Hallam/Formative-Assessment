        <div>Mental health is complex but can have a deeply negative effect on a person. Below is some information and some simple things to consider when thinking about mental health. </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Mental wellbeing and physical activity</h3><p>Regular physical activity is known to improve mental health, quality of life, and wellbeing. It also helps prevent and treat heart 
                disease, stroke, diabetes, and breast and colon
             cancer, and more. Despite these benefits being well established, over a third of UK adults do not meet the recommended amount of activity.
             Our bodies and our minds are connected, so looking after ourselves physically also helps us prevent problems with our mental health. Exercise releases “feel good” hormones, that
              reduce feelings of stress and anger. It also helps us feel better about our bodies. It can improve our sleep too. If it involves other people, like being part of a team, a class
               or group we see regularly, that can also boost our mental health.</p></div>
        <div>
            <h3>Sleep and mental health</h3>
            <p>We all need to sleep well to help our bodies recover from the day and allow healing to occur.

                But a lot of us struggle to get a good night’s sleep, and the consequences can be more serious than feeling grumpy or unfocused. Sleep and mental health are closely related: 
                living with a mental health condition can affect your sleep, and poor sleep can affect your mental health.</p>
            <h5>How can mental health problems affect sleep?</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Anxiety can cause your thoughts to race, which can make it harder to sleep.</li>
                <li>Depression can lead to oversleeping, sleeping late or sleeping during the day. It can also cause insominia.</li>
                <li>Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can cause nightmares or night terrors.</li>
                <li>Mania can make you feel elated or energetic, so you might not feel tired or want to sleep. You may also have racing thoughts that make it hard to sleep.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Stress</h3>
            <p>Stress is our body’s response to pressure. Many different situations or life events can cause stress. It is often triggered when we experience something new
                 or unexpected that threatens our sense of self or when we feel we have little control over a situation.

                We all deal with stress differently. Our ability to cope can depend on our genetics, early life events, personality and social and economic circumstances.
                
                When we encounter stress, our body produces stress hormones that trigger a fight or flight response and activate our immune system. This helps us respond quickly to dangerous
                 situations.
                
                Sometimes, this stress response can be helpful. It can help us push through fear or pain so we can run a marathon or deliver a speech, for example. Our stress hormones usually 
                return to normal quickly once the stressful event is over, and there won’t be any lasting effects.
                
                However, too much stress can cause adverse effects. It can leave us in a permanent stage of fight or flight, leaving us overwhelmed or unable to cope. Long term, this can affect 
                our physical and mental health.</p>
