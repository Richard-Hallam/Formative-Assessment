            <h3>Mental wellbeing and physical activity</h3><p>Regular physical activity is known to improve mental health, quality of life, and wellbeing. It also helps prevent and treat heart 
                disease, stroke, diabetes, and breast and colon
             cancer, and more. Despite these benefits being well established, over a third of UK adults do not meet the recommended amount of activity.
             Our bodies and our minds are connected, so looking after ourselves physically also helps us prevent problems with our mental health. Exercise releases “feel good” hormones, that
              reduce feelings of stress and anger. It also helps us feel better about our bodies. It can improve our sleep too. If it involves other people, like being part of a team, a class
               or group we see regularly, that can also boost our mental health.</p></div>

            <h3>Sleep and mental health</h3>
            <p>We all need to sleep well to help our bodies recover from the day and allow healing to occur.

                But a lot of us struggle to get a good night’s sleep, and the consequences can be more serious than feeling grumpy or unfocused. Sleep and mental health are closely related: 
                living with a mental health condition can affect your sleep, and poor sleep can affect your mental health.</p>
            <h5>How can mental health problems affect sleep?</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Anxiety can cause your thoughts to race, which can make it harder to sleep.</li>
                <li>Depression can lead to oversleeping, sleeping late or sleeping during the day. It can also cause insominia.</li>
                <li>Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can cause nightmares or night terrors.</li>
            </ul>
