## Design Decisions

### Colour Palette

These colours were chosen to provide a calming theme for the project while maintaining stylistic consistency.

### Wireframes
Include wireframes for key sections of your website.  
Briefly describe the design choices, including layout, colour schemes, and fonts.  
**Guidance:** Start this section during Phase 1: Ideation & Initial Setup and update it throughout Phase 2 and Phase 3. Include digital wireframes created in Phase 1. Document the reasoning behind your layout choices, colour schemes, and font selections.
**Homepage mobile layout**
![Mobile Wireframe image](assets/Wireframes/mobileWireframe.png)
This is the layout for mobile. In this version the menu is hidden and makes use of a burger button for a clean look.
**About Desktop layout**
![Desktop wireframe Image](assets/Wireframes/DesktopWireframeAbout.png)
This is the layout for desktop. Making use of the extra space to hide the burger button and instead showing the menu at all times. The menu will always be visible. The content is laid out in containers with the text containers being twice as large as the images and the images with padding taking up a third of the page.

### Typography
**Font**
https://fonts.google.com/share?selection.family=Lexend+Deca:wght@100..900
This font was chosen for both the main body text because it looks neat and is was designed for people with dyslexia and other reading problems in mind. This has the added benefit of increasing accessability. The fallback font is sans-serif. 

### Accessibility Considerations
Discuss how accessibility guidelines were adhered to, including colour contrast and alt text for images.  
**Guidance:** Outline how you've incorporated accessibility into your design, ensuring that your project adheres to guidelines such as WCAG.

## AI Tools Usage

### DALL-E
Describe how DALL-E was used for image generation, including examples of successes and challenges.  
**Guidance:** Specifically mention how you used DALL-E for image generation and the impact this had on your design process.

## Features Implementation

### Core Features (Must-Haves)
- **Feature 1:** Description of the implemented feature.
- **Feature 2:** Description of the implemented feature.

(Include all must-have features)  
**Guidance:** Use this section as you complete Phase 2: Must User Stories Implementation & Testing. Document all the must-have features you implemented, explaining how they align with the user stories and acceptance criteria.

### Advanced Features (Should-Haves)
- **Feature 1:** Description of the implemented feature.
- **Feature 2:** Description of the implemented feature.

(Include all should-have features)  
**Guidance:** Include any advanced features you implemented during Phase 3: Should User Stories Implementation & Any Advanced Features. Explain how these features enhance user experience and their alignment with the acceptance criteria.

### Optional Features (Could-Haves)
- **Feature 1:** Description of the implemented feature (if any).
- **Feature 2:** Description of the implemented feature (if any).

(Include any could-have features that were implemented or considered)  
**Guidance:** If any could-have features were implemented, describe them here. This is an opportunity to showcase extra work done beyond the initial scope. But remember - keep it simple! Focus on the Must stories first. Could user story features are commonly earmarked for future project iterations.

## AI Tools Usage

### GitHub Copilot

**Guidance:** Reflect on how GitHub Copilot assisted in coding, particularly any challenges or adjustments that were needed to align with project goals.

## Testing and Validation

### Testing Results
Summarize the results of testing across different devices and screen sizes.  
Mention any issues found and how they were resolved.  
**Guidance:** Summarize the results of your testing across various devices using tools like Chrome DevTools, as outlined in Phase 2. Mention any issues found and how they were resolved.

### Validation
Discuss the validation process for HTML and CSS using W3C and Jigsaw validators.  
Include the results of the validation process.  
**Guidance:** Document your use of W3C and Jigsaw validators to ensure your HTML and CSS meet web standards. Include any errors or warnings encountered and how they were resolved.
