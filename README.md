## Design Decisions

### Colour Palette
![Image of the colour palette chosen for this project](assets/Wireframes/ColourPalette.png)
These colours were chosen to provide a calming theme for the project while maintaining stylistic consistency.

### Wireframes
Include wireframes for key sections of your website.  
Briefly describe the design choices, including layout, colour schemes, and fonts.  
**Guidance:** Start this section during Phase 1: Ideation & Initial Setup and update it throughout Phase 2 and Phase 3. Include digital wireframes created in Phase 1. Document the reasoning behind your layout choices, colour schemes, and font selections.
**Homepage mobile layout**
![Mobile Wireframe image](assets/Wireframes/mobileWireframe.png)
This is the layout for mobile. In this version the menu is hidden and makes use of a burger button for a clean look.
**About Desktop layout**
![Desktop wireframe Image](assets/Wireframes/DesktopWireframeAbout.png)
This is the layout for desktop. Making use of the extra space to hide the burger button and instead showing the menu at all times. The menu will always be visible. The content is laid out in containers with the text containers being twice as large as the images and the images with padding taking up a third of the page.

### Typography
**Font**
https://fonts.google.com/share?selection.family=Lexend+Deca:wght@100..900
This font was chosen for both the main body text because it looks neat and is was designed for people with dyslexia and other reading problems in mind. This has the added benefit of increasing accessability. The fallback font is sans-serif. 

### Accessibility Considerations
Attributes for screen readers were included throughout the project. Font choice as explained in the above section was also decided based on accessibility.

## Features Implementation

### Core Features (Must-Haves)
- **Easy to navigate:** The website is a single page application with a fix menu that allows quick navigation to the different sections of the site.
- **Links take the user to other pages** All links have been tested and open the correct external resource in a new tab
- **No issues with the website** The website was checked for readability on multiple screen sizes and run through a html and css validator to check for errors.
- **Is accessible for visually impaired users** All images have descriptive alt attributes and the nav bar has the correct aria tags for screen readers.

### Advanced Features (Should-Haves)
- **The site is usable on both mobile and desktop:**Testing of both mobile and desktop screen sizes was conducted using chrome dev tools.
- **Content is easy to read:** A contrasting font colour was chosen and the font family was selected with readability in mind.
(Include all should-have features)  

### Optional Features (Could-Haves)
- **Elements react when moused over:** Not implimented would be distracting on elements other than possibly the external links.
- **The page loads quickly:** Images were selected with fast loading in mind. 

(Include any could-have features that were implemented or considered)  
**Guidance:** If any could-have features were implemented, describe them here. This is an opportunity to showcase extra work done beyond the initial scope. But remember - keep it simple! Focus on the Must stories first. Could user story features are commonly earmarked for future project iterations.


## Testing and Validation

### Testing Results
Testing layout on various screen sizes was done using chrome dev tools. Testing of loading speed was done on a slow 3g network using my mobile phone in a chromium based mobile browser.

### Validation
**CSS validation**
![image of css validation](/assets/Wireframes/css%20validator.png)
Css was validated using the w3c validation service. The first run identified a missing comma in the font family causing the fallback font of sans serif to be used impacting readability.


**HTML validation**
![Image of HTML validation](/assets/Wireframes/html-validator.png)
HTML was validated using the w3c validation service. The first run identified one stray div closing tag which was then rectified.

## Deployment

### Deployment Process
This site was deployed using github pages by navigating to settings> pages then choosing to deploy from a branch and setting that branch to be main. 

## Reflection on Development Process
The project deployment was the simplest part of the project.

### Challenges
The main challenges I faced were laying content out using bootstrap, making the navbar and ensuring backgrounds adapted well to other screen sizes.

### Final Thoughts
This project really helped me get my head around using bootstrap and was excellent practice for writing media queries,

## Future Improvements
The main improvement would be further refinement of the responsive design. I consider this an mvp. There are still tweaks to be made especially around devices with narrower aspect ratios such as 21:9 smartphones. Also I am not happy with some of the images being slightly off center on smaller displays so that would need extra time to solve.
